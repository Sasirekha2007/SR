THEORY

SR Flip-Flop SR flip-flop operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. Whereas, SR latch operates with enable signal. The circuit diagram of SR flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has two inputs S & R and two outputs Qtt & Qtt’. The operation of SR flipflop is similar to SR Latch. But, this flip-flop affects the outputs only when positive transition of the clock signal is applied instead of active enable. The following table shows the state table of SR flip-flop.



Here, Qtt & Qt+1t+1 are present state & next state respectively. So, SR flip-flop can be used for one of these three functions such as Hold, Reset & Set based on the input conditions, when positive transition of clock signal is applied. The following table shows the characteristic table of SR flip-flop. Present Inputs Present State Next State

By using three variable K-Map, we can get the simplified expression for next state, Qt+1t+1. The three variable K-Map for next state, Qt+1t+1 is shown in the following figure.

The maximum possible groupings of adjacent ones are already shown in the figure. Therefore, the simplified expression for next state Qt+1t+1 is Q(t+1)=S+R′Q(t)Q(t+1)=S+R′Q(t)


PROGRAM
module SR (
    input  wire clk, rst, S, R,
    output reg  Q
);
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (rst)
            Q <= 1'b0;         // Reset
        else begin
            case ({S,R})
                2'b00: Q <= Q;     // No change
                2'b01: Q <= 1'b0;  // Reset
                2'b10: Q <= 1'b1;  // Set
                2'b11: Q <= 1'bx;  // Invalid
            endcase
        end
    end
endmodule
